      'I have served as a Mobile and Web Developer, utilizing Flutter with Nest.js and Firebase services. My role involved direct client interaction, where I ensured their expectations were met through autonomous planning and execution. I developed expertise in using FlutterFlow and Google Cloud tools such as Cloud Functions, Google Scheduler, and Google Pub/Sub. Additionally, I implemented performance-focused architectures in Flutter, enhancing my proficiency on the platform. On the backend, I worked with Node.js and Nest.js, integrating Supabase for database management and authentication. I also configured deployments to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, ensuring compliance with store guidelines and setting up internal testing systems with TestFlight.',
